		<p>
			This website offers a Cubic Bezier Function for defining a Cubic Bezier curve, typically characterized by four points. However, it lacks user-friendly explanations, making it challenging for new users like myself to navigate. The presence of color codes does help with orientation, but the overall website layout could benefit from improvement.
            Regarding efficiency, the website proves less speedy due to its layout and can pose a learning curve for users unfamiliar with the function. Additionally, in terms of safety, it lacks error recovery mechanisms, requiring a page refresh to start anew, which can be time-consuming.

		<a href="https://webcode.tools/generators/css"><h3>CSS FEATURE DEMO 2 - CSS GENERATOR</h3></a>
		<p>
			This website serves as a hub for CSS generators, offering a comprehensive resource to educate users about various CSS properties. Clicking the link reveals a straightforward layout with a list of all CSS properties. It proves user-friendly for those with some prior knowledge of CSS properties, but beginners might find it slightly more complex. This complexity arises when a property is selected, leading users to a page with tools that lack explanatory information.
            On the positive side, in terms of efficiency, the website operates swiftly and is generally user-friendly. In matters of safety, it boasts minimal errors, and any mistakes made can be easily rectified.
